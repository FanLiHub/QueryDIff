# QueryDiff
[ICML 2025] Official implement of &lt;Better to Teach than to Give: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation via Agent Queries with Diffusion Model Guidance>
- [x] Evaluation
- [ ] Training

## Setup Environments

To set up your environment, execute the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n querydiff -y
conda activate querydiff
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.0"
pip install "mmsegmentation>=1.0.0"
pip install "mmdet>=3.0.0"
pip install xformers=='0.0.20' # optional for DINOv2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

The preparation process follows a similar procedure to that of [DDB](https://github.com/xiaoachen98/DDB).

**GTA:** Please, download all image and label packages from [here](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/) and extract them to `data/gta`.

**Cityscapes:** Please, download leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip and gt_trainvaltest.zip from [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/) and extract them to `data/cityscapes`.

**Mapillary:** Please, download MAPILLARY v1.2 from [here](https://research.mapillary.com/) and extract them to `data/mapillary`.

**ACDC:** Download all image and label packages from [ACDC](https://acdc.vision.ee.ethz.ch/) and extract them to `data/acdc`.

## Pretraining Weights

The stable diffusion model weights can be obtained from https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1.

DINOv2 weights can be obtained from https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2.

## Evaluation

Run the evaluation:

```
python tools/test.py /path/to/cfg /path/to/checkpoint --backbone /path/to/backbone
```
